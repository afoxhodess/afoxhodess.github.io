<h1>Ana Fox-Hodess</h1>
<!-- <img src="images/KidsInFrontYard.jpg"> -->
<p>Ana Fox-Hodess (1988 Berkeley) is California-based artist. She studied visual arts and Latin American studies at Brown University (2006-2010), photography, printmaking and video art at the University of Chile (2011), and recently received a Master in Media Arts at the University of Chile. Her work engages with the relationship between media, memory and history: the archive: voyeurism and exhibitionism in the digital age; and the limits between craft and new media technologies. Principal research interests include participatory art, interactivity, and the construction of non-linear narratives. </p>
