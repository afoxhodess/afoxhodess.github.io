		<h2 id="who">Who we are</h2>
		<p>Labor Rising is an assembly of workers, unemployed and underemployed people, students and activists coming together to mobilize our co-workers, communities, families and friends, foster organizing in our workplaces, and express our collective resistance to the oppressive conditions we face and will increasingly face under a Trump presidency. We welcome everyone who agrees to use this space to practice forms of radical equality, anti-oppressive politics and democratic decision making to plan collective actions, educate ourselves, and forge a powerful labor movement.</p>

		<p> 
 
		While the catalyst for this assembly has been the widespread outrage and sense of a need to respond quickly—and mobilize against—the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States, we hope this group will become a sustainable space of learning, organizing and action to build worker's power through collective action.
